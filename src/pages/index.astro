          Thank you for visiting my homepage! My name is Hikari Otabi, currently
          an assistant professor at the Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology,
          Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, Japan.

          I was born in Shimane, Japan, and moved to Ibaraki, Japan when I
          entered university. I conducted research on delayed nest building in
          mice exposed to social defeat stress at the Laboratory of Feed
          Science, College of Agriculture, Ibaraki University, Japan under the
          tutorage of Prof. Atsushi Toyoda and obtained my B.S., M.S., and Ph.D.
          degrees. Iâ€™m doing the above study and more information is available
          in <a href="/about" class="font-bold underline">About me</a>. After
          obtaining my Ph.D. degree, I worked at Setsunan University in Osaka,
          Japan for one year on a project for the Japan Agency for Medical
          Research and Development. Under the tutorage of Prof. Ryo Inoue, I
          conducted research on the establishment of an infectious disease
          testing system for xenotransplantation.

        <p class="m-5">
          As you can see, I have moved to many different places since I entered
          college, and all of them have been very wonderful. In Osaka, I was
          close to Kyoto, so I rode my road bike to Arashiyama and other places.
        </p>

        <p class="m-5">
          No matter where in the world I my research do, I like to have a good
          time in every situation. I also believe that, as the Japanese saying
          goes, "Amadareishi wo ugatsu (constant dropping wears away a stone)",
          and that if you persevere in small things, you will eventually achieve
          great things.
