    title="Why is nest-building behavior impaired in stressed mice?"
    desc="The social defeat stress model is widely used in depression research. We found that nest-building behavior was delayed in mice exposed to social defeat stress (Otabi et al., 2016)."

  <Interest
    title="Development of rapid screening method for psychotropic drugs"
    desc='We believe that the nest-building delay phenomenon in mice may be a powerful evaluation for depression-like behavior to evaluate "motivation". A simple and rapid screening method for psychotropic drugs was developed (Otabi et al., 2017).'

  <Interest
    title="Development of animal behavior analysis system"
    desc="An objective nest-building analysis system was developed using a 3-D depth camera that can observe behavior even in 24-hour darkness to analyze the full extent of the nesting deficit. Nest building was assessed by nest volume to determine differences in nesting patterns between control and stressed mice (Otabi et al., 2020)."

    title="Elucidation of the neural basis of “nest-building behavior”"
    desc="I’m also interested in the neural basis of nest-building behavior in mice and other animal species."
